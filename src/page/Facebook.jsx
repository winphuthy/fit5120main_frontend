            <p>Facebook is a social media platform that allows you to create your own personal profile. It will
                allow you to connect with your families and friends, allowing you to share photos and videos, and
                view photos and videos by other users. It helps people keep one another updated with whatâ€™s going on
                in their lives. Facebook can also be used as a messaging service to communicate with your facebook
                friends.</p>
