                        <h3>Why are we doing this?</h3>
                        <p>Our team at Silicon Sharks have come to realise that more and more things in life are becoming readily accessible only to those with both knowledge and access to technology. We know from our data on the left of this, that Victorians from the age of 50 and above have always struggled to feel as digitally included as people in other age groups. Donâ€™t believe it?</p>
                        <p>Filter through the different years to see the ever-present Digital Divide. With more and more things becoming digitised, we want to provide an easy to navigate platform in which users can easily learn how to access a multitude of digital services and platforms that they could then integrate into their lives, by providing clear yet concise step-by-step instructions on how to do the things they would like to do.</p>
